# Advanced JS - Homework 01

## Requirements

### Create a table with with data from the Ricky and Morty episode endpoint

url: https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode

1. The table has to contain columns for id, name , air_date, url and episode (the season and episode tag), dont include the characters array and created.

2. Implement a _Load Data_ button and _Next_ and _Previous_ that work similar to what Igor did.

3. It is not mandatory to use higher order functions but try to implement them as much as possible, experiment and console.log() if you get stuck.

### Bonus #1

- Try implementing the above with using only fetch() , no jQuery

### Bonus #2

- Add another column that will have a button in it that will say _Details_ , clicking on this button should show the user the details (Manipulate innerHTML instead of another .html file) where the data for a specific episode will be fetched like this: `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode/1`.

- Display the details for the episode you already had in the table but also display on screen the character avatars in a table or array ( your choice ) or if this proves too challenging just display the urls for the characters.

_If you need help of any kind about anything, ask in class or send us an email, this homework is purely for practice and the bonus requirements are completely optional and you as students lose nothing if you dont do them_

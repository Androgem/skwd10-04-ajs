# Callback Homework

## Basic Requirement

- Write functions that work like .map , .filter and .forEach.
- These functions need to take an array and a callback as parameters.
- .map and .filter should return a new array while forEach needs to mutate the original array as it works in its original implementation.

## Bonus Requirement (OPTIONAL)

- Write the same functions above only this time make them callable for every array (example: array.myMap, array.myFilter, array.myForEach)
- The only parameter these functions need is the callback, while we are calling the functions as methods on the array itself.
- To do this you need to use the array prototype ( google and research are your best friends here )
- They should return the same values as the original HOF do.
